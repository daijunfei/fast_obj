if the obj object has more than 1000k vertices,use the build-in obj importer will be very slow sometimes take half an hour since it is written with python.
I written this OBJ importer using C++ code.it is a lot faster than the python implement.
although it not be optimized with code. I will continue improve the speed of import in the next version.
there is no exporter currently , but will make it.
